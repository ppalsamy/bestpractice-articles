# Test Driven Development 
## What is TDD?
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a technique for building software that guides software development by writing tests.

Specifically, TDD uses a 3 step loop:

1) **Red** - Introduce a test for desired functionality that fails (or doesnâ€™t compile). 
2) **Green** - Apply design principle Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS). do the change to make tests pass. 
3) **Refactor** - Make your code clean by applying Desgin patterns and principles like Don't Repat Yourselves(DRY) or Duplicate Is Evil(DIE).
